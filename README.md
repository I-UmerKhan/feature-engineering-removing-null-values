# feature-engineering-removing-null-values
I handled null values in the dataset through careful preprocessing techniques. This involved initially assessing the extent and distribution of missing data across features. For features where null values were present, I employed strategies like imputation, filling missing values with statistical measures such as mean, median, or mode depending on the data distribution. In cases where imputation wasn't feasible or appropriate, I considered removing rows or columns with a substantial number of missing values to maintain data integrity.
